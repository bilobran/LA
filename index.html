                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood">1.Hollywood</a><p class="simple1"><br>Hollywood 
            is a neighborhood in the central region of 
            Los Angeles, California, notable as the home of the U.S. film 
            industry including several of its historic studios. Its name has 
            come to be a shorthand reference for the industry and the people 
            associated with it.  Hollywood was incorporated as a municipality in
            1903. It was consolidated with the city of Los Angeles in 1910 and 
            soon thereafter a prominent film industry emerged, eventually 
            becoming the most recognizable film industry in the world.</p>

            2.The Mount Wilson Observatory</a> 
            <p class="simple2">The Mount Wilson Observatory(MWO) is an astronomical observatory in
            Los Angeles County, 
            California, United States. The MWO is located on Mount Wilson, a 
            1,740-metre (5,710-foot) peak in the San Gabriel Mountains near 
            Pasadena, northeast of Los Angeles.The observatory contains two 
            historically important telescopes: the 100-inch (2.5 m) Hooker 
            telescope, which was the largest aperture telescope in the world 
            from its completion in 1917 to 1949, and the 60-inch telescope 
            which was the largest operational telescope in the world when it was
            completed in 1908. It also contains the Snow solar telescope 
            completed in 1905, the 60 foot (18 m) solar tower completed in 1908,
            the 150 foot (46 m) solar tower completed in 1912, and the CHARA 
            array, built by Georgia State University, which became fully 
            operational in 2004 and was the largest optical interferometer in 
            the world at its completion.</p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland">3.Disneyland
            </a><p class="simple3">Disneyland park, originally Disneyland, is the 
            first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, 
            California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park 
            designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of 
            Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; 
            its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it 
            from the expanding complex in the 1990s.</p>

            referred to as the Getty, is an art museum in California housed
